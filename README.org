** config of my emacs
   to use this config :
   #+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/juteman/konfig_emacs.git  ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC
*** about c/c++ setting
    now I find maybe LSP is the best for c++ on emacs.
    i used to use irony gtags.
    but now I use [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#supported-languages][lsp-mode]] to do code completion and so on.
    the servers i use is ccls
    when you use this config,you should build ccls first.
    or you can't use c/c++ config.
****  when read the linux source code and other huge source code
     I find that use lsp is hard to read the hugo source code. the best way I think is to use the old
     ways -- tags. So download gnu global, and use emacs or use htags to view code in staic website
*** about python
    use
    #+BEGIN_SRC
pip install 'python-language-server[all]'
    #+END_SRC
    add the lsp of python.then enjoy it.
